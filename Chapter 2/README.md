The main algorithmic patterns in computer Science are:
* Recursion

* Divide and Conquer Strategy

* Dynamic Programming

* Greedy Approach

---------------------------------

A recursive algorithm calls itself repeatedly in order to solve the problem until a certain condition is fulfilled. A recursive function can be in an infinite loop; therefore, it is required that each recursive function adheres to certain properties. At the core of a recursive function are two types of cases:

1. Base cases: These tell the recursion when to terminate, meaning the recursion will be stopped once the base condition is met
2. Recursive cases: The function calls itself recursively, and we progress toward achieving the base criteria.

**In the dynamic approach, we divide a given problem into smaller sub-problems. In recursion also, we divide the problem into sub-problems. However, the difference between recursion and dynamic programming is that similar sub-problems can be solved any number of times, but in dynamic programming, we keep track of previously solved sub-problems**

Two Examples of Recursion:
* Factorial with recursion technique: [Contribution guidelines for this project1](Chapter 2/factorialWithRecursion.py)
* Fibonacci Series with recursion technique: [Contribution guidelines for this project2](Chapter 2/fibonacciSeriesWithRecursion.py)
